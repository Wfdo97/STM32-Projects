# STM32-Projects

This repository includes project files, practice files and useful pointers for the course Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development. 
 - This course delve into the internal working of the Microcontroller (STM32) and its Peripherals.
 - Coding for the Peripherals STEP-BY-STEP and Developing software drivers entirely from scratch by extracting maximum information from Datasheets, Reference manuals, specs, etc
 - Protocol Decoding Using logic analyzers, Debugging, Testing along with Hints and Tips.

## Debugging Methods
- Single stepping
- Disassembly and register
- Breakpoints
- Expression and variable windows
- Memory browser windows
- Call stack and fault analyzers
- Data watch points
- SFR windows
